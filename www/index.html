<b>Flip</b> is a logical framework written in Python.  A logical
framework is a library for defining logics and writing applications
such as theorem provers.  One Flip application is a proof checker for
entering and editing proofs in natural deduction style:

This is the output from the checker.  Here is
the <a href="summary.html">proof script</a>.
Here is a <a href="witch.html">more Pythonic example</a>.

<p>
The checker can use different logics; Flip comes with several.  You
can <a href="logics.html">add another logic</a>, or add axioms
and derived rules, by writing a module in Python.  Python is both the
object language and the metalanguage.  Formulas, inference rules, and
entire proofs are Python expressions.  Prover commands are Python
functions.  The Python interpreter itself is the only user interface
to the proof checker application.  (It is not necessary to know much
Python to <a href="userguide-nd.html">use the checker</a>.)
</p>

<p>
Flip was undertaken as a Python programming exercise.  It is not
intended to compete with industrial-strength theorem provers such as
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/HOL/history.html">HOL</a>,
nor with nicely-designed educational provers such as 
<a href="http://users.comlab.ox.ac.uk/bernard.sufrin/jape.html">Jape</a>, 
<a href="http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/digimath/">etc.</a>
That said, the checker is quite capable of working the examples and
exercises in university-level textbooks on logic for computer science or
mathematics, such as
<a href="http://web.mat.bham.ac.uk/R.W.Kaye/logic/">Kaye</a>,
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/lics/">Huth and Ryan</a>,
and
