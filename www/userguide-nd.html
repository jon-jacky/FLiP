<h3><a name="nd">Natural deduction</h3>

<p>
The checker works with proofs expressed in natural deduction style.
The checker can use different logics; Flip comes with several.  Here
is a proof in first-order logic based on an example from Kaye,
displayed by the checker's pp command:

<pre>
Kaye ex. 9.12, ~Ax.P(x) |- Ex.~P(x)  (0)  Comment

Ex.~P(x)                 (12)  Not-Elimination (11)
</pre>

<p>
A proof in this style is a sequence of steps.  Each step must include
a formula (on the left above) and a justification (on the right).  The
justification always includes the name of an inference rule and often
includes premises, other steps in the proof.  Premises are indicated
by their step numbers.  Proofs begin with steps whose rule is Given or
Assumption, which have no premises.

<p>
Making an assumption begins a subproof, indicated here by indentation
and vertical bars.  Discharging an assumption closes the subproof.  A
step in a subproof can only be justified by premises in the same
subproof or in enclosing subproofs (including the main proof).

<hr>

<h3><a name="interact">Interactive proof</h3>

<p>
The checker supports forward proof.  We can only work on one goal at a
time.  We can only add a step at the end of the proof, or delete steps
from the end.  If a proffered step is invalid, the checker prints an
error message and does not add the step to the proof.  Therefore,
every step in the stored proof is valid and justified.

<p>
The only user interface to the checker is the Python interpreter itself.
Formulas, inference rules, and entire proofs are Python expressions.
Checker commands are Python functions.  You do not need to know much
Python to use the checker, just follow the directions here.

<p>
Here we demonstrate a few prover commands to enter a proof with no
errors.  Demonstrations of <a href="#err">error handling</a> appear
below.  A complete list of commands (including several not shown here)
appears in the <a href="reference-nd.html#commands">reference</a>.

<p>
To begin an interactive proof session, start the Python interpreter
with the session file for the logic we wish to use.  The proof in this
example uses first-order logic (fol).  Other Flip logics are discussed
in the <a href="reference-nd.html#logics">reference</a>.

<pre>
python -i fol_session.py
>>>
</pre>

<p>
Python starts, runs the session file, and prints its command prompt.
Now we can type checker commands at the prompt.

<p>
In many Python versions, we can edit in the command line with the
right- and left-arrow keys and the backspace and delete keys.  We can 
retrieve earlier commands to repeat or edit with the up- and down-arrow keys.

<p>
Use the <b>clear</b> command to start a new proof, or to start over.
All command invocations are function calls, so we must
put parentheses after the command name, even when there are no
arguments:

<pre>
>>> clear()
</pre>

<p>
Use the <b>checkp</b> command (check and print) to enter the next
proof step.  The arguments to this command are the formula, the rule,
and possibly some premises.

<p>
At this time Flip does not provide a parser. Formulas are ordinary
Python expressions.  We must enter formulas in prefix syntax with
operator names.  Then checkp prints the formula in infix syntax with
operator symbols:

<pre>
>>> checkp(Not(A(x, P(x))), given)
~Ax.P(x)                  (0)  Given
</pre>

<p>
The variable x and the relation P are defined by running the fol_session
module, as are all the logical operators including Not and A (for
all).  That module defines several other variables, relations, and
functions, and we can define more during a proof session; see the <a
href="reference-nd.html#notation">reference</a>.

<p>
Python uses zero-based indexing, so the first proof step is always
number 0.  We usually like to put a comment there, so the first
formula in the proof appears in step 1.  Let's remove that step 0 and
put in a comment instead.  Use the <b>back</b> command to remove the
last step from the proof.

<pre>
>>> back()
</pre>

<p>
The comment goes in the formula argument to checkp, coded like this:
<code>Text('...')</code>.  The rule argument is <code>comment</code>.
Once again, checkp prints the step.

<pre>
>>> checkp(Text('Kaye ex. 9.12'), comment)
Kaye ex. 9.12             (0)  Comment
</pre>

<p>
Use checkp to enter the first few steps

<pre>
>>> checkp(Not(A(x, P(x))), given)
~Ax.P(x)                  (1)  Given
>>> checkp(Not(E(x, Not(P(x)))), assume)
|~Ex.~P(x)                (2)  Assumption
>>> checkp(New(x), new)
||Let x be arbitrary      (3)  New variable for subproof
>>> checkp(Not(P(x)), assume)
|||~P(x)                  (4)  Assumption
</pre>


<p>
Then use <b>pp</b> (pretty-print) to show our progress so far:

<pre>
>>> pp()
Kaye ex. 9.12             (0)  Comment
~Ax.P(x)                  (1)  Given
|~Ex.~P(x)                (2)  Assumption
||Let x be arbitrary      (3)  New variable for subproof
|||~P(x)                  (4)  Assumption
</pre>

<p>
Use checkp to add a step with a premise.  The premise is the third
argument.

<pre>
>>> checkp(E(x, Not(P(x))), Ei, 4)
|||Ex.~P(x)               (5)  E-Introduction (4)
</pre>

<p>
Some rules have more than one premise; use as many arguments as needed.

<pre>
>>> checkp(F, contra, 5, 2)
|||F                      (6)  Contradiction (5) (2)
</pre>

<p>
The <b>rapply</b> (rule apply) command is an alternative to checkp for
steps that have premises.  It is usually the most convenient
way to enter a step.  Just enter the rule and the premise numbers;
rapply itself generates the formula.

<pre>
>>> rapply(raa,4,6)
||~~P(x)                  (7)  Reductio Ad Absurdum (4) (6)
>>> rapply(ne,7)
||P(x)                    (8)  Not-Elimination (7)
>>> rapply(Ai,3,8)
|Ax.P(x)                  (9)  A-Introduction (3) (8)
>>> rapply(contra,9,1)
|F                       (10)  Contradiction (9) (1)
>>> rapply(raa,2,10)
~~Ex.~P(x)               (11)  Reductio Ad Absurdum (2) (10)
>>> rapply(ne,11)
Ex.~P(x)                 (12)  Not-Elimination (11)
</pre>

<p>
To use rapply with the Ae rule, you must also provide a term or
variable to substitute for the bound variable, like this:
<code>rapply(Ae, 1, x)</code>.  For the Ei rule, you must also provide
a dictionary that shows how to replace the term in the premise with a
bound variable.  For example, we could do step 5 (above) this way:

<pre>
>>> rapply(Ei,4,{x:x})
|||Ex.~P(x)               (5)  E-Introduction (4), with { x:x }
</pre>

<p>
Here the dictionary <code>{x:x}</code> commands the checker to replace
the term <code>x</code> in step 4 with the bound variable
<code>x</code>.

<p>
Use pp to show the finished proof:

<pre>

Ex.~P(x)                 (12)  Not-Elimination (11)
</pre>

<p>
The <b>ptree</b> (print tree) command is an alternative to pp that
prints the proof as a tree with the conclusion at the root, where each
premise is indented under the formula it justifies:

<pre>
>>> ptree()
Ex.~P(x)                 (-1)  Not-Elimination (11)
  ~~Ex.~P(x)               (11)  Reductio Ad Absurdum (2) (10)
    ~Ex.~P(x)                (2)  Assumption
    F                       (10)  Contradiction (9) (1)
      Ax.P(x)                  (9)  A-Introduction (3) (8)
        Let x be arbitrary      (3)  New variable for subproof
        P(x)                    (8)  Not-Elimination (7)
          ~~P(x)                  (7)  Reductio Ad Absurdum (4) (6)
            ~P(x)                  (4)  Assumption
            F                      (6)  Contradiction (5) (2)
              Ex.~P(x)               (5)  E-Introduction (4)
                ~P(x)                  (4)  Assumption
              ~Ex.~P(x)                (2)  Assumption
      ~Ax.P(x)                  (1)  Given
</pre>

<p>
This format suggests an alternative to forward proof: backward proof
from conclusions to premises.  However, at this time the checker does
not support backward proof.

<hr>

<h3><a name="save">Save and restore</h3>

<p>
Use the <b>save</b> command to save work in progress to resume later,
or to save a completed proof.  The save command takes one argument, a
string, the name of the module where the proof is saved:

<pre>
>>> save('ex912')
Saved in ex912.py
</pre>

<p>
The save command writes the file in the current working directory,
replacing the file if it already exists.  The saved file is a Python
module with one attribute: the saved proof, whose name is the same as
the module name.  The proof can be restored into a Python session by using the
<b>import</b> statement:

<pre>
>>> from ex912 import ex912
</pre>

<p>
To resume work on the proof, execute the <b>check_proof</b> command
with the name (not quoted) we assigned.  The check_proof command
checks and prints each step:

<pre>
>>> check_proof(ex912)
Kaye ex. 9.12             (0)  Comment
~Ax.P(x)                  (1)  Given
|~Ex.~P(x)                (2)  Assumption
... <em>etc.</em> ...
Ex.~P(x)                 (12)  Not-Elimination (11)
>>>
</pre>

<p>
Now we could continue editing, issuing checker commands at the prompt.

<hr>

<h3><a name="err">Err and recover</h3>

<p>
The preceding example is a bit unrealistic because all of the
proffered steps are valid.  The whole purpose of a proof checker is to
catch invalid steps and other errors.  If a proffered step is
erroneous, the checker prints a message, and the step is not added to
the proof.  The stored proof is still valid, so we can always recover
by simply trying again.

<h4>Invalid steps</h4>

<p>
At step 5, we might have attempted:

<pre>
>>> checkp(E(x,P(x)),Ei,4)
|||Ex.P(x)                (5)  E-Introduction (4)
'Fail: Ex.P(x) does not match Ev1.S1 with { S1:~P(x), v1:x }'
</pre>

<p>
Here checkp checks its formula and premise arguments against the
inference rule for E-introduction.  They do not match, so the step
fails.  The message indicates that the formula contains P(x) while the
premise contains ~P(x).  The formula should contain ~P(x) as well.
Try again:

<pre>
>>> checkp(E(x,Not(P(x))),Ei,4)
|||Ex.~P(x)               (5)  E-Introduction (4)
</pre>

<p>
This step is valid; checkp accepts it and adds it to the proof.

<p>
A complete list of error messages appears in the <a
href="reference-nd.html#errors">reference</a>.

<h4>Type errors</h4>

<p>
Flip's first-order logic distinguishes two types of formulas: Formula
(with a capital F), and Term.  Arguments of logical operators (And,
etc.) must be Formulas, while arguments of functions or relations
(Equal, etc.) must be Terms.  Variables are Terms, while Letters
(Boolean variables) are Formulas.  Using a Letter where a Variable is
expected is a type error:

<pre>
>>> checkp(E(q,Not(P(q))),Ei,4)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "C:\Users\jon\Documents\prover\code\fol.py", line 41, in __init__
    Relation.__init__(self, *args)
  File "C:\Users\jon\Documents\prover\code\formula.py", line 154, in __init__
    check_type(self, Term, *args)
  File "C:\Users\jon\Documents\prover\code\formula.py", line 607, in check_type
    (self.__class__.__name__, i, a.ppf(), type(a), arg_type)
TypeError: P argument 0, q is &lt;class 'formula.Letter'&gt;, must be &lt;class 'formula.Term'&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The problem indicated here is that the formula uses the Letter q as the argument of the relation P, where a Variable or another Term is required.

<p>
Another kind of type error occurs when the first argument of the
checkp command is not a formula.  For example, recall that a comment
must be encoded this way: <code>Text('...')</code>.  If we fail to do
this, it is a type error:

<pre>
>>> checkp('Kaye ex. 9.17 ...', comment)
"Fail: Kaye ex. 9.17 ... is &lt;type 'str'&gt;, must be Formula"
</pre>


<h4>Syntax errors</h4>

<p>
Commands and formulas are just Python expressions, so syntax errors are
signaled by the Python interpreter:

<pre>
>>> checkp(E(x,Not(P(x)))),Ei,4)
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    checkp(E(x,Not(P(x)))),Ei,4)
                               ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
</pre>

<p>
The problem here is too many closing parentheses after P(x).

<p>
If we attempt to use an identifier that is not defined, Python prints
a message like this:

<pre>
>>> checkp(E(j,Not(P(j))),Ei,4)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'j' is not defined
</pre>

<p>
The problem here is that we tried to use j as a variable, but it is
not defined in the fol_session module, or in the current session.

<p>
Command invocations are function calls so we must include the
parentheses, even when there are no arguments.  If we omit them,
Python prints a message like this:

<pre>
>>> pp
&lt;function pp at 0x02232270&gt;
</pre>

<hr>

<h3><a name="info">Show information</h3>

<p>
The <b>dir</b> command shows identifiers that are defined in
the Python session, including all the prover commands, rules, logical
operators, variables, functions and relations:

<pre>
>>> dir()
['A', 'Ae', 'Ai', 'And', 'Apply', 'E', 'Ee', 'Ei', 'Equal', 'F', 'Formula', 
... <em>etc.</em> ...
'top', 'trans', 'u', 'v', 'v1', 'v2', 'w', 'x', 'xr', 'xx', 'y', 'z']
</pre>

<p>
Type any identifier to print information about it:

<pre>
>>> x
&lt;formula.Variable object at 0x02222A30&gt;
>>> p
&lt;formula.Letter object at 0x02222AB&gt;
>>> P
&lt;class 'fol.P'&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The <b>help</b> command often prints useful information:

<pre>
>>> help(P)
Help on class P in module fol:

class P(formula.Relation)
 |  Example of relation, used in Kaye ex 9.16, 9.17 , Huth and Ryan sect. 2.3
 |  ... <em>etc.</em> ... 
</pre>

<p>
The <b>help</b> command prints the arguments and other information
about any function, including prover commands:

<pre>
>>> help(checkp)
Help on function checkp in module nd:

checkp(formula_arg, rule, *premises_etc)
    Check step and update proof state, pretty-print step, print error
</pre>

<p>
The <b>rules</b> command shows all the inference rules in the session.
In each rule, the premises appear first, the conclusion appears last:

<pre>
>>> rules()
[('comment', ['m1']),
 ('impli', ['m1', 'm2', 'Impl(m1,m2)']),
 ('oil', ['m2', 'Or(m1,m2)']),
 ('raa', ['m1', 'F', 'Not(m1)']),
 ('ai', ['m1', 'm2', 'And(m1,m2)']),
 ... <em>etc.</em> ...
</pre>

<p>
The <b>apropos</b> command shows the inference rules that
involve the operator given in the argument:

<pre>
>>> apropos(Not)
[('raa', ['m1', 'F', 'Not(m1)']),
 ('oer', ['Or(m1,m2)', 'Not(m2)', 'm1']),
 ('oel', ['Or(m1,m2)', 'Not(m1)', 'm2']),
 ('ne', ['Not(Not(m1))', 'm1']),
 ('contra', ['m1', 'Not(m1)', 'F'])]
</pre>

<p>
The <b>rule_names</b> attribute associates each rule name with its description.
Use <b>pprint</b> to format the output:

<pre>
>>> pprint(rule_names)
{'Ae': 'A-Elimination',
 'Ai': 'A-Introduction',
 ... <em>etc.</em> ...
</pre>

<hr>


<h3><a name="batch">Batch proof</h3>

<p>
An entire proof can be represented by a Python expression: a list of
tuples, where each tuple is a step.  We can use a text editor to
create a file that contains a proof.  Here are the contents of ex912_test.py:

<pre>
from fol_session import *

ex912 = \
  [(Text('Kaye ex. 9.12, ~Ax.P(x) |- Ex.~P(x)'), comment),
    (Not(A(x, P(x))), given),
    (Not(E(x, Not(P(x)))), assume),
    (New(x), new),
    (Not(P(x)), assume),
    (E(x, Not(P(x))), Ei, 4),
    (F, contra, 5,2),
    (Not(Not(P(x))), raa, 4,6),
    (P(x), ne, 7),
    (A(x, P(x)), Ai, 3,8),
    (F, contra, 9,1),
    (Not(Not(E(x, Not(P(x))))), raa, 2,10),
    (E(x, Not(P(x))), ne, 11)]

check_proof(ex912)
</pre>

<p>
Run Python on the file to check the proof:

<pre>
> python ex912_test.py
Valid A-intro, Kaye ex. 9.12, ~Ax.P(x) |- Ex.~P(x)  (0)  Comment

|~Ex.~P(x)                (2)  Assumption
||Let x be arbitrary      (3)  New variable for subproof
... <em>etc.</em> ...
</pre>

<p>
The check_proof function checks and prints each step.  If the
step fails, check_proof prints an error message and exits.

<hr>

<h3><a name="examples">Examples</h3>

<p>
The <a href="../test">test modules</a> contain many proofs in each of
the Flip logics.  They demonstrate every formula class and inference rule.
Each test case is coded as a <a href="#batch">batch proof</a>.

The proof format printed by the pp command resembles the one in Kaye.
Similar formats are used by Huth and Ryan, Bornat, and many other
logic textbooks.  Sometimes this is called Fitch style.  Other proof
styles are discussed by Gries and Schneider.
