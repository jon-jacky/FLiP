Introduction 

This document discusses the nd module in the Flip logical framework.
Before reading this, it would be helpful to look over the Flip web pages and
the overall design document.

The nd module provides proof checking and editing.  It manages proof
state, provides prover commands, print/display, and save.


Natural deduction

The nd module checks and edits proofs expressed in natural deduction
style.  Here is an example:

Kaye ex. 9.12, ~Ax.P(x) |- Ex.~P(x)  (0)  Comment
~Ax.P(x)                  (1)  Given
|~Ex.~P(x)                (2)  Assumption
||Let x be arbitrary      (3)  New variable for subproof
|||~P(x)                  (4)  Assumption
|||Ex.~P(x)               (5)  E-Introduction (4)
|||F                      (6)  Contradiction (5) (2)
||~~P(x)                  (7)  Reductio Ad Absurdum (4) (6)
||P(x)                    (8)  Not-Elimination (7)
|Ax.P(x)                  (9)  A-Introduction (3) (8)
|F                       (10)  Contradiction (9) (1)
~~Ex.~P(x)               (11)  Reductio Ad Absurdum (2) (10)
Ex.~P(x)                 (12)  Not-Elimination (11)

Each line shows a proof step with a formula and justification.  The
justification always includes the name of an inference rule and often
includes premises, other formulas in the proof.  Premises are
indicated by their line numbers.

Making an assumption begins a subproof, indicated here by indentation.
Discharging an assumption closes the subproof.  A step in a subproof
can only be justified by premises in the same subproof or in enclosing
subproofs (including the main proof).

The prover only provides commands (functions) to add a
step at end, or delete steps from the end.


Proof state

The proof state is stored in the steps attribute, a list of tuples,
one for each step in the proof.  It can be displayed by the state()
command:

>>> state()
(0, 'xr', (), ((),), "Text('Kaye ex. 9.12, ~Ax.P(x) |- Ex.~P(x)')", 'comment')
(1, 'xr', (), ((),), 'Not(A(x, P(x)))', 'given')
(2, 'ar', (2,), ((), ()), 'Not(E(x, Not(P(x))))', 'assume')
(3, 'ar', (3, 2), (('x',), (), ()), 'New(x)', 'new')
(4, 'ar', (4, 3, 2), ((), ('x',), (), ()), 'Not(P(x))', 'assume')
(5, 'xr', (4, 3, 2), ((), ('x',), (), ()), 'E(x, Not(P(x)))', 'Ei', 4)
(6, 'xr', (4, 3, 2), ((), ('x',), (), ()), 'F', 'contra', 5, 2)
(7, 'dr', (3, 2), (('x',), (), ()), 'Not(Not(P(x)))', 'raa', 4, 6)
(8, 'xr', (3, 2), (('x',), (), ()), 'P(x)', 'ne', 7)
(9, 'dr', (2,), ((), ()), 'A(x, P(x))', 'Ai', 3, 8)
(10, 'xr', (2,), ((), ()), 'F', 'contra', 9, 1)
(11, 'dr', (), ((),), 'Not(Not(E(x, Not(P(x)))))', 'raa', 2, 10)
(12, 'xr', (), ((),), 'E(x, Not(P(x)))', 'ne', 11)

That the proof state stores the same information as is shown by the
pp() command, plus some additional information.  In each step:

- The second item is the rule category: 'ar' (assumer), 'dr'
(discharger), or 'xr' (other).  

- The third item is the subproof stack, with the step number of the
assumption that begins the current subproof first, then the step
number of the beginning of the enclosing subproof, etc.  

- The fourth item is the free variable stack.  Each entry in the
stack is the tuple of variables that are free in that subproof.

The subproof stack is necessary to print the indentation, and to check
whether cited premises are in a correct scope.

The free variable stack is necessary because the Let and New commands
introduce new variables, which must not be free in the proof already.

The subproofs and free variables are stored in stacks that can be 
popped when an assumption is discharged and a subproof is closed.

The subproof stack and free variable stack are included in each step
so they can be restored easily when steps are deleted.  (Otherwise it
would be necessary to regenerate them by re-executing the proof from
the beginning each time a step was deleted.)


Processing a step

To process each step, the check function is called with these
arguments: the formula, the rule, and the step numbers of the
premises.  The check function collects all the premises and the
conclusion (the formula), checks that all premises are present and in
proper scope.  Then the check function calls the check_rule
function.  

The check_rule function compares each premise, and finally the
conclusion, to the patterns in the rule in the pertinent logic module,
by calling the mismatch methods in the formula module.  As it goes,
check_rule binds placeholders in the patterns in the rules to the
subformulas from the premises and conclusion, storing the bound pairs
in the subformulas dictionary used by the mistmatch methods.  This is
discussed in more detail in formula.txt.

If check_rule finds that the rule is valid, check adds it to the end
of the proof state.  Otherwise, check issues an error message and does
not add the step to the proof state.  Then control returns to the
Python interpreter.  IN an interactive session, the user may issue
another command.

If an exception is thrown while processing a step, the proof state is
not updated and control returns to the Python interpreter.  The user
may issue another command.


Proof automation

The nd module provides rudimentary proof automation.  Instead of
providing the formula for each step, you can provide just the rule and the
premises (and, for some quantifier rules, a term or two).

This is implemented by the rapply command (because you apply the rule
to the premises to get the formula --- Python already has a built-in
apply command).  The rapply function calls check, passing a special
Apply() pseudo-formula argument.  Apply is a subclass of Formula but
behaves as a prover command, not a formula.  Apply() commands
check_rule to invoke the conclusion pattern's generate method instead
of its mismatch method.  check_rule then assigns the returned
generated formula to the global formula attribute.  The formula has to
be a global attribute, rather than an argument, because it might be
rebound in the body of check_rule.


Integration, modular structure

The nd module works with different logics, but imports none of them.
A proof session does not import the nd module directly.  Instead, it
imports a session module, which imports a config module, which imports
nd and also one or more logic modules as well.  See design.txt for
details.


Alternatives

Flip could be extended to support to other proof styles.

Backward proof, where the proof state is a tree with the goal at the
root and premises at the nodes, uses the same logics and inference
rules but a different presentation and interaction style.  Interaction
works backwards from the goal, filling in premises.  This could be be
implemented in Flip by writing a different proof module than nd.

Equational proof, where proofs are sequences of formulas related by
equality (or other relations), uses different logics (than natural
deduction), where most rules are axioms (rules without premises).
Interaction usually generates the next formula by substituting into
the previous formula.  This could be implemented in Flip by writing a
new proof module and new logics (with lots of axioms); they could use
the existing formula module.
